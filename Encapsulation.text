Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a process of combining 
data and function into a single unit 
like capsule. This is to avoid the 
access of private data members from 
outside the class. To achieve 
encapsulation, we make all data 
members of class private and create 
public functions, using them we can 
get the values from these data 
members or set the value to these 
data members.
