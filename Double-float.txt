float vs. double

The precision of a floating point 
value indicates how many digits the 
value can have after the decimal 
point. The precision of float is 
only six or seven decimal digits,
 while double variables have a 
precision of about 15 digits. 
Therefore it is safer to use 
double for most calculations.
