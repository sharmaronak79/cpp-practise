Object oriented programming is a way of solving 
complex problems by breaking them into 
smaller problems using objects. 
Before Object Oriented Programming (commonly referred as OOP),
 programs were written in procedural language,
 they were nothing but a long list of 
instructions. On the other hand, 
the OOP is all about creating objects 
that can interact with each other,
 this makes it easier to develop programs 
in OOP as we can understand the relationship 
between them.
