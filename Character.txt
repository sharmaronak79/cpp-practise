Character Types
The char data type is used to 
store a single character. 
The character must be surrounded 
by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

Example
char myGrade = 'B';
cout << myGrade;

Alternatively, you can use ASCII 
values to display certain 
characters:

Example
char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67;
cout << a;
cout << b;
cout << c;
