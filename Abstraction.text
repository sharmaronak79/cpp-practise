Abstraction

Abstraction is a process of hiding
 irrelevant details from user. 
For example, When you send an sms 
you just type the message, select 
the contact and click send, 
the phone shows you that the message 
has been sent, what actually happens 
in background when you click send is 
hidden from 
you as it is not relevant to you.
